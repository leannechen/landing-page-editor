As reliance on data grows, so does the need for professionals who can analyze and interpret it effectively.\n\nThe **Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, led by industry leader Sean Barnes, equips you with the skills to manage the entire data lifecycle, from defining problems to delivering insights. With this certificate, you'll be prepared to pursue an entry-level role in data analytics or strengthen your current role with a solid foundation in data analysis.\n\nThe skills you'll gain are in high demand, and with **data science roles projected to grow 36% from 2023 to 2033** according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, developing these skills puts you at the forefront of a data-centric world.\n\nYou'll begin by learning the foundations of analysis and visualization, then move on to statistical techniques that support evidence-based decision-making. Next, you'll develop Python skills to automate workflows and analyze data at scale (no prior coding experience required!). Then, you'll work with real-world data to extract information from websites, APIs, and databases, and clean data with Python and SQL to prepare it for analysis.\n\nFinally, you'll learn to present your analysis in ways that support real decisions through clear writing, compelling visualizations, and interactive dashboards. You'll also prepare for the job search with practical guidance on resumes, portfolios, and interviews.\n\nUnique to this program is its integration of AI tools into the analytics workflow. You'll learn to use large language models as a thought partner, accelerating tasks like simulation modeling, formula debugging, and data visualization. Each of the course examples comes from real-world use cases, building practical and immediately useful skills.\n\nWhether you're a software engineer working with data pipelines, a marketer or business analyst extracting insights, or building a career in data analysis, you'll gain the foundation to excel in the data economy. Blending core statistical methods with AI-assisted workflows, this program is perfect for beginners entering the field as well as experienced practitioners looking to expand their analytical toolkit."
